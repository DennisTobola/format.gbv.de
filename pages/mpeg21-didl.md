The basic architectural concept in MPEG-21 is the Digital Item. Digital Items are structured digital objects, including a standard representation, identification and metadata. They are the basic unit of transaction in the MPEG-21 framework. More concretely, a Digital Item is a combination of resources (such as videos, audio tracks, images, etc), metadata (such as descriptors, identifiers, etc), and structure (describing the relationships between resources).

This second part of MPEG-21 (ISO/IEC 21000-2:2003) specifies a uniform and flexible abstraction and interoperable schema for declaring the structure and makeup of Digital Items. Digital Items are declared using the Digital Item Declaration Language (DIDL) and declaring a Digital Item involves specifying its resources, metadata and their interrelationships.
