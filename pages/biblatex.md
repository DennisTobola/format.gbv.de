BibLaTeX is a com­plete reim­ple­men­ta­tion of the bib­li­o­graphic fa­cil­i­ties pro­vided by LaTeX. For­mat­ting of the bib­li­og­ra­phy is en­tirely con­trolled by LaTeX macros, and a work­ing knowl­edge of LaTeX should be suf­fi­cient to de­sign new bib­li­og­ra­phy and ci­ta­tion styles. BibLaTeX uses its own data back­end pro­gram called “biber” to read and pro­cess the bib­li­o­graphic data. With biber, BibLaTeX has many fea­tures ri­valling or sur­pass­ing other bib­li­og­ra­phy sys­tems.
